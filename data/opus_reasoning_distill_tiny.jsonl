The phrase \"the same thing\" inherently implies a comparison - something can only be \"the same\" in relation to something else.\n\nIf Thorn thought \"the same thing\" as someone else, this means:\n- Someone else had a particular idea/thought\n- Thorn had that identical idea/thought\n- Two people having the identical thought = **agreement**\n\nTherefore, the premise establishes that Thorn **did agree** with at least one person's ideas.\n\nThe hypothesis claims \"Thorn did not agree with anyone else's ideas\" - which directly contradicts what the premise tells us.\n\nSince the premise indicates Thorn agreed with someone (by thinking the same thing they thought), the hypothesis is **false**."}]}

This announcement comes as the Democratic primary season reaches its conclusion, with Senator Barack Obama having secured the necessary delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nThe two senators spoke by phone on Wednesday, marking their first conversation since Obama clinched the nomination. However, contrary to widespread speculation, sources confirm that the possibility of Clinton joining the ticket as Obama's vice presidential running mate was not discussed during this call. This conversation appears to have been an initial step toward party unification rather than a negotiation for a potential \"dream ticket.\"\n\nRepresentative Charles Rangel, a prominent Clinton supporter from New York, expressed some disappointment with Clinton's concession speech on Tuesday night. Rangel suggested that Clinton \"could've been far more generous\" in her remarks following Obama's historic achievement. The congresswoman's speech, while acknowledging Obama's accomplishment, stopped short of a formal concession, leading to mixed reactions from party members and the media.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Obama has expressed optimism about healing any divisions within the Democratic Party. In recent statements, Obama declared he is \"very confident\" in his ability to unite Democrats by November's general election. The presumptive nominee has begun shifting his focus toward the general election contest against Republican Senator John McCain while extending olive branches to Clinton and her supporters.\n\nClinton's suspension of her campaign on Saturday is expected to include a formal endorsement of Obama, which party leaders hope will begin the process of bringing the two fiercely competitive campaigns together. The exact details of Saturday's event have not yet been released, but it is anticipated to be a significant moment in the 2008 presidential race as Democrats seek to present a unified front heading into the national convention and general election."}]}

The passage discusses the relationship between the Virgin Mary and the Egyptian goddess Isis, noting iconographic similarities and scholarly suggestions of a connection between Marian devotion and Isis worship.\n\n2. The question asks specifically: \"What is the name of the goddess that the Virgin Mary met in Egypt?\"\n\n3. I need to examine what the passage actually states versus what the question is asking:\n   - The passage mentions parallels between images of Isis and Mary\n   - It discusses scholarly theories about iconographic relationships\n   - It mentions suggestions of a link between the \"cult of Mary\" and the \"cult of Isis\"\n\n4. Critical distinction: The passage discusses comparative religious scholarship and potential historical/evolutionary relationships between religious traditions. It does not claim that Mary physically met Isis or any other goddess in Egypt.\n\n5. In Christian tradition, Mary did travel to Egypt (the Flight into Egypt with Joseph and baby Jesus to escape Herod), but this journey is described in the Gospel of Matthew with no mention of meeting any deities.\n\n6. The question appears to create a false premise by suggesting a meeting occurred between Mary and a goddess, when no such meeting is recorded in any religious tradition, historical document, or even in the provided text itself.\n\n7. The passage discusses relationships between religious traditions and artistic representations, not a personal encounter between Mary and a deity.\n</think>\n\nThis question is unanswerable.\n\nThe passage discusses scholarly theories about iconographic similarities and possible historical connections between Marian devotion and the worship of Isis. However, it does not describe any actual meeting between the Virgin Mary and a goddess.\n\nThe question creates a false premise by suggesting such a meeting occurred. While Christian tradition does mention Mary traveling to Egypt (the Flight into Egypt), there is no record in religious texts, historical documents, or scholarly literature of her meeting any Egyptian goddess during that time.\n\nThe passage only addresses comparative religious scholarship regarding artistic representations and the evolution of religious practices, not a personal encounter between these religious figures."}]}

It was traditionally shown every Thursday evening on BBC One, except for a short period on Fridays in mid-1973 before being again moved to Fridays in 1996 and then to Sundays on BBC Two in 2005. Each weekly programme consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, there was a special edition of the programme on Christmas Day (and usually, until 1984, a second such edition a few days after Christmas), featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year.\n\nBy 1994, much of the 'Year Zero' revamp was quickly undone and the arrival of Ric Blaxill as producer in February 1994 signalled a return to presentation from established Radio 1 DJs Simon Mayo, Mark Goodier, Nicky Campbell and Bruno Brookes. Blaxill expanded the use of \"via satellite\" performances, taking the acts out of studios and concert halls and setting them against landmark backdrops. As a consequence, Bon Jovi performed Always from Niagara Falls and Celine Dion beamed in Think Twice from Miami Beach.  The last remnants of the Year Zero revamp were replaced in 1995, when a new title sequence, logo and theme tune were introduced (the logo having first been introduced on the new programme Top of the Pops 2 some months previous), coinciding with the introduction of a new set. Blaxill also increasingly experimented with handing presenting duties to celebrities, commonly contemporary comedians and pop stars who were not in the charts at that time. In an attempt to keep the links between acts as fresh as the performances themselves, the so-called \"golden mic\" was used by, amongst others, Kylie Minogue, Meat Loaf, Des Lynam, Chris Eubank, Damon Albarn, Harry Hill, Jack Dee, Lulu and Jarvis Cocker. Radio 1 DJs still presented occasionally, notably Lisa I'Anson, Steve Lamacq, Jo Whiley and Chris Evans.  TOTP was traditionally shown on a Thursday night, but was moved to a Friday starting on 14 June 1996, originally at 7 pm, but then shifted to 7.30 pm, a change which placed the programme up against the soap opera Coronation Street on ITV.
